Approach:
Our choice for this project is to work on a web scraper that is built on a distributed
system with the use of Google Cloud. Inspired by a research paper[1] using AWS EC2
instances and Selenium to create their own distributed web scraper, our team would like to try
and create this on the Google Cloud Platform as opposed to Amazon’s AWS. The
aforementioned research paper focuses their software on data mining for Big data applications.
We would like to apply this data mining for food recipe aggregation[2]. Our goal is to show that if
our software is able to fill a database such as a food recipe database, then there are many
types of databases that can also be populated.
